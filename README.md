Make sure the library you write is worth its name! Don't call some leftpad library "reindent". That's kinda mean to others who need that name...

Generate your own list:

```
cat /usr/share/dict/words | grep "^re" | less
```

- Readme
- Reassess
- Rebound
- Rescind
- Redefine
- Reflect
- Refund
- Regroup
- Regroup
- Reject
- Release
- Remedy
- Remember
- Remind
- Remove
- Resent
- Resource
- Respectable
- Revenge
